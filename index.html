<h3>The story</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate.
    They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
    said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky.
        What a <em value="good">great</em> turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q></p></strong>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <em value="bad">bad</em></q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
    because he had a broken leg.
    Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">Isn’t that <em value="good">great</em>!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <em value="good">good</em> or <em value="bad">bad</em> —
    because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
    consequences of <em value="good">good</em> fortune.
